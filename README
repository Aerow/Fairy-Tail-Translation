For all the contributors of this fan-made translation, 
Thank you for spending your time helping with the translation in anyway possible. With the help of a decent amount of people, this project can achieve a better result than what it would have if only one person were to work on it.

// Character size :
An important thing regarding translations is the length of the characters. If the Japanese word has 4 characters, the maximum number of English characters that can be used to replace that word is 2*(the number of jap characters), which in this case is 8.

// An important note to all the people willing to contribute :
If you want to help out with the translation, edit the files in the following way :
[Japanese text] : [Translated English text] : [Actual Meaning]
and save the file after you are done. An example can be seen in the 'items' file.
The hard part is naming the items. All the items are to be given custom names which are not finalized. 

Hope the translation will be a success.     ~Aerow@PSPISO
