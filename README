For all the contributors of this fan-made translation, 
Thank you for spending your time helping with the translation in anyway possible. With the help of a decent amount of people, this project can achieve a better result than what it would have if only one person were to work on it.

// An important note to all the people willing to contribute :
If you want to help out with the translation, edit the files in the following way :
[Japanese text] : [Translated English text]
and save the file after you are done. An example can be seen in the 'items' file.

Hope the translation will be a success.     ~Aerow@PSPISO
